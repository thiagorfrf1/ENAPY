Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) <br>

(ENA) is a method for identifying and quantifying connections between elements in coded data and representing them in dynamic network models. A key feature of the ENA tool is that it allows researchers to compare different networks, both visually and through summary statistics that reflect the weighted structure of the connections. The interface also allows users to see the original data that contributed to each of the connections in the network representation. Thus, ENA can be used to address a wide range of qualitative and quantitative research questions.

Researchers have used ENA to analyze and visualize a wide range of phenomena, including: cognitive connections that students make while solving complex problems; interactions between different regions of the brain in fMRI data; coordination of social gaze; integration of operational skills during surgical procedures; and many others.

# Why use the library?
Another advantage is that the original rena library is being used as the engine, all updates and future new functions can be used with the library.

# Installing

## Pip:

## pip install enapy

# Usando o enapy
The example in the example folder shows how to use the library. All Python libraries can be used to manipulate and arrange data to be plotted.

All functions of the library can be called using the rENA interface, another detail is that dots (.) should be replaced by underscores (_).
## Exemple: 
The ena.plot() function can be called using rENA.ena_plot()

The ena.plot.points() function can be called using rENA.enaplotpoints().

# Requirements:
## Python 3.6

rpy2


## R 

data.table

rENA

## Necessary libraries:
The R libraries rENA and data.table must be installed using the commands below:
## install.packages("rENA")
## install.packages("data.table")

In Python, we must install the rpy2 library using the following command:

pip install rpy2

## Exemples
Examples are available in the ena.ipynb file in the “examples” folder.
